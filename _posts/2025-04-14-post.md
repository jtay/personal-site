Shoehive is a lightweight TS/JS game server framework designed to create a simple platform for building multiplayer table games. It runs in a Node.js environment and is designed to be easily integrated with a React frontend with the sidecar `shoehive-react-client` package.

I built this framework to learn more about building multiplayer games and to create a simple platform for building tabletop games. After building a few games without it, I decided to extract the framework to provide simplicity and a standardised API for building games.
