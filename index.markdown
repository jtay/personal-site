👋 Hey! 

I'm Jaydon, I specialise in building bespoke backend Shopify apps and integrations. From starting web development from the age of 13, I've built a deep understanding of programming fundamentals and a passion for building clean, scalable systems. 

Currently full-time at [Onstate](https://onstate.co.uk), a Shopify Plus Premier Partner agency offering a range of commercial services from strategy to implementation.

I'm a huge advocate for open source software and enjoy building complex systems with a focus on developer experience.
